# Vaishnavi Kadam

I build things that think and make people feel something.

I’m a software engineer who loves the middle ground between clean code and human connection.  
Some days that means designing AI systems that actually listen. Other days it’s debugging until everything finally feels right.

I’ve worked across full-stack and AI projects, from real-time systems at Uber to chatbots that talk like they mean it.  
I care about clarity, calm interfaces, and code that tells a good story.

**Currently exploring:** conversational AI, scalable frontends, and why “simple” is always the hardest thing to build.
